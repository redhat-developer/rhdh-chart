# RHDH Backstage Helm Chart for OpenShift

See [charts/backstage/README.md](charts/backstage/README.md).

## Why this chart?

This is the "upstream" chart for RHDH, formerly the janus-idp chart.

To alleviate the confusion of having charts in this repo and [artifacthub](https://artifacthub.io/packages/helm/rhdh-chart/backstage), AND the official charts in the [Openshift Helm Charts](https://github.com/openshift-helm-charts/charts) repo @ https://charts.openshift.io/ we intend to merge this content into the downstream chart via this issue: https://issues.redhat.com/browse/RHIDP-1477

## Contributing and reporting issues

To report issues against this chart, please use JIRA (not GH issues): https://issues.redhat.com/browse/RHIDP
